Details on plan types, prices, and payment methods follow the information on the Service screen.</li>

      </ol>

      <h3>Article 10 (Withdrawal of Subscription and Refund Policy)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Right of Withdrawal</strong>: Users of paid services, such as Instructor Members, may request withdrawal of subscription (cancellation of payment) for the paid use contract (subscription) within 7 days from the payment date within the scope determined by relevant laws. However, if the Service has already been used (e.g., issuing an invitation code to register a Student Member or using the class reservation management function) even within that period, withdrawal may be restricted.</li>
        <li><strong>Refund Conditions</strong>: If a refund is requested within 7 days of payment without using any paid features of the Service, the Company will refund the full subscription fee paid. If 7 days have passed since the start of the subscription or any part of the Service has been used, refunds are generally not possible. This is a measure considering the reduction in economic value upon use due to the nature of the Service as digital content.</li>
        <li><strong>Refund Application and Processing</strong>: Members wishing for a refund must apply through the Customer Center or the procedure guided by the Company. The Company will check the request within 3 business days from the receipt of the refund request and proceed with payment cancellation or refund if the reason for refund complies with this clause. If the refund is approved, the Company will pay the refund amount to the means used for payment within 7 business days from the approval date. However, it may take some time to complete the refund depending on the processing schedule of the payment provider (e.g., card company, app market).</li>
        <li><strong>Exceptions to Refund</strong>: Withdrawal of subscription may be restricted in accordance with relevant laws in any of the following cases:
          <ul class="sub-list">
            <li data-marker="a)">If the benefits generated or obtained by the Member through the paid service (subscription) exist at the time of the refund request (e.g., remaining service benefits already issued).</li>
            <li data-marker="b)">If there is a justifiable reason why a refund is impossible due to the Member's fault.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Article 11 (Privacy Protection)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The Company collects and uses personal information of Members to provide the Service and manages it safely in accordance with relevant laws.

        <li>The Company does not provide Members' personal information to third parties without consent, and details regarding personal information processing follow the separately disclosed Privacy Policy. The Company takes administrative and technical safety measures to prevent unauthorized leakage or misuse of personal information.</li>
        <li>For smooth operation, minimum personal information (name, contact, etc.) necessary for service use may be mutually provided between Members. Instructor Members can check information necessary for class proceedings, such as names and reservation status of invited Student Members, and Student Members can also check necessary information such as the profile and contact of the participating Instructor. Such provision is made within the purpose of Service provision, and Members can use the Service only if they agree to this.</li>
        <li>To protect the personal information of children under 14, the Company notifies that sign-up for users under 14 requires the consent of a legal representative. If the Company becomes aware that a child under 14 has signed up without such consent, it will immediately suspend the account and delete personal information.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Article 12 (Copyright and Restrictions)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Copyright and intellectual property rights for the Service and its components (text, images, logos, etc.) belong to the Company. However, the copyright of content uploaded by Members during Service use (profile photos, posts, etc.) belongs to the respective Member.</li>
        <li>Members shall not reproduce, transmit, publish, distribute, or otherwise use for commercial purposes or allow third parties to use information obtained through Service use that belongs to the Company or provider without prior consent.</li>
        <li>If a Member uploads materials for which they do not own the copyright or infringes on another's copyright, the Member bears legal responsibility, and the Company is not responsible. If the Company is notified or becomes aware of such infringement, it may take necessary measures such as suspending or deleting the content.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Article 13 (Limitation of Liability and Indemnification)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Indemnification for Transactions between Instructor and Member</strong>: The Company is not directly responsible for actual offline or online class activities, such as class proceedings and guidance, between Instructor Members and Student Members.

        <li><strong>Indemnification for Member's Fault</strong>: The Company is not responsible for damages caused by Member's intent or negligence, damages arising from negligence in managing accounts and invitation codes, or damages from claims raised by third parties due to Member's violation of these Terms.</li>

      </ol>

      <h3>Article 14 (Dispute Resolution)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The Company operates a Customer Center to handle Member complaints or dispute mediation. Users can submit inquiries or complaints via the app menu or disclosed contact information. The Company strives to process legitimate opinions or complaints promptly and will notify the reason and schedule if processing is delayed.</li>
        <li>If a dispute arises between the Company and a Member regarding these Terms, they shall strive to resolve it through mutual consultation. If not resolved, they may follow procedures under relevant laws and apply for dispute resolution to the Personal Information Dispute Mediation Committee, KISA Counseling Center, etc., if necessary.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Article 15 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction)</h3>
